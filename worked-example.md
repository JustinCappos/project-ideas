# Task

Implement and deploy a distributed advertise service for Seattle Testbed.

*What does that mean?* Decompose into parts and ask again!

### Implement
Our code word for "create all the code, tests, and documentation required
for the described task."

### Deploy
"Run said implementation as a public service. We may give you a VM on our
cluster for this."

### Distributed
This will run on multiple computers the world over.

### Advertise service
Seattle Testbed's (qv) way to let programs announce data under arbitrary
keys, and look up all of the announced data using that key.

### Seattle Testbed
Glad you asked! https://seattle.poly.edu/
